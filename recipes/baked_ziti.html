    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This baked ziti is always a hit! A lady I worked with brought this in one day, and everyone loved it. Now it is the favorite of all my dinner guests. I have made this also without the meat, and it is well received.</p>
    <h4>Ingridients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound dry ziti pasta</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>6 ounces provolone cheese, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, brown ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat; stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
